// Race condition -- when mutliple threads tries to update a shared resource, a race condition will occur and
// the end result is un-defined.

// we can solve the race condition with multiple technique ( like using a serial queue, semaphore, lock)
// But the ultimate goal to solve the race condition is the shared resource must be accessed by a single thread,
// concurrent access should be blocked.
// we can solve this using multiple technique --> (1) lock (2) semaphore (3) serial queue (4) concurrent queue
